# Go-Corona-game
This is a game i made using python and its library "pygame". during the lockdown time due to the corona in 2020 i got a chance to build this game, which is nostalgic for me because I grew up playing many Miniclips games  and here i was able to create such type of game and with the little taste of modification 
to download and play the game simply downlaod the whole folder and you must have environmental variable favourable for python and have one IDE to run python project and there you go, you can run the file execute it and play and enjoy.
